![Ransomware Detection](https://cysight.ai/wp-content/uploads/NFA-Ransomware-Detection.png)

## Overview

This repository hosts the research project **"Ransomware Detection and Mitigation Framework"**, which explores the evolving cyber threat of ransomware. The project aims to develop a comprehensive framework to enhance the detection and prevention of ransomware attacks, leveraging advanced technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). This framework not only focuses on improving detection accuracy but also on minimizing the impact of ransomware through robust mitigation strategies.

## Key Features

- **Integration of AI and ML:** Enhances the adaptability and accuracy of ransomware detection methods.
- **Multi-layered Defense Systems:** Incorporates a combination of signature-based and behavior-based detection approaches.
- **Prevention Measures:** Emphasizes the importance of regular software updates, multi-factor authentication, and user education to reduce vulnerabilities.
- **Incident Response Planning:** Highlights the critical role of legal compliance and continuous research in creating resilient defenses.

## Research Objectives

1. **Review Current Detection Methods:** Analyze the strengths and limitations of existing ransomware detection techniques.
2. **Develop a Comprehensive Framework:** Propose a framework that integrates AI and ML to enhance ransomware detection and prevention.
3. **Examine Mitigation Strategies:** Focus on prevention measures and incident response to minimize the impact of ransomware.
4. **Highlight Human Factors:** Emphasize the role of user education and awareness in strengthening cybersecurity defenses.
5. **Explore Future Trends:** Suggest areas for future research, including emerging ransomware variants and the economic implications of ransom payments.

The proposed framework consists of several interconnected modules:

1. **Detection Module:** Utilizes AI and ML algorithms to identify ransomware based on behavior and signatures.
2. **Prevention Module:** Implements security measures like multi-factor authentication, software updates, and user education programs.
3. **Mitigation Module:** Focuses on incident response planning, legal frameworks, and continuous adaptation to evolving threats.
4. **Collaboration Module:** Encourages international collaboration to combat ransomware on a global scale.
